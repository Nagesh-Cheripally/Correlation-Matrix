# Correlation-Matrix

A correlation matrix is a table that shows all of the relationships between a set of variables (it often also shows whether or not these relationships are statistically significant).

Although it’s highly recommended that you use some form of significance testing to evaluate the size of correlation obtained, some general rules of thumb for interpreting the size of correlations have been developed, especially when you have extremely large samples where even very small correlations are likely to be statistically significant

      .00 to .20 No correlation to “negligible” positive 
      .20 to .40 Weak to moderately strong positive 
      .40 to .60 Moderately strong positive 
      .60 to .80 Strong to very strong positive 
      .80 to 1.00 Very strong to "perfect" 
      .00 to -.20 No correlation to “negligible” negative 
      -.20 to -.40 Weak to moderately strong negative 
      -.40 to -.60 Moderately strong negative 
      -.60 to -.80 Strong to very strong negative 
      -.80 to -1.00 Very strong to "perfect" negative
